       <h2 class="featurette-heading">VuLink SDI-12 Setup</h2>
       <p class="lead">VuLink is a telemetry device that works with all kinds of water monitoring instruments. Its job is to upload data from those instruments to the cloud. There are different ways VuLink can get that data from an instrument. One of those ways is called SDI-12. That's a communication protocol, which just means it's a bunch of rules about the order in which bits and bytes must move from one device to another.</p>

       <p class="lead">This project features the SDI-12 setup portion of the VuSitu mobile app. It's simple because the UX and software teams worked hard to make it that way. I wrote all of the text for this feature.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">About the Project</h2>

    <p class="lead">VuLink users needed to be able to connect to SDI-12 instruments using the VuSitu app. The process had to be as straightforward as everything else in VuSitu.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">My Approach</h2>
    <p class="lead">This was the first project the UX team completed after I proposed a new approach. Prior to building SDI-12 support into VuSitu, new features usually started with a meeting between the UX designer and project manager. Once they reached a shared understanding of what needed to happen, the designer made wireframes. When all looked good, developers built the features and I added the final text later. That worked, but it left me with a lot to do at the end.</p>

    <p class="lead">My suggestion was to start with the words. I wanted to write the interaction between software and user as a conversation. The goal was to understand what information needed to go back and forth as soon as possible. My hope was that the UX designer would be able to create wireframes and I'd know what the interaction looked like before developers built it.</p>

    <p class="lead">This process is still evolving, but you can see how the user scripts—that's what we're calling them—flush out details before the design work begins. To write the conversation, it's necessary to think about what the app needs from the user and vice versa. The process of writing these scripts prompts lots of important questions.</p>

       <img class="img-thumbnail" src="./Images/sdi12Script1.png"/>
     </div>
     <div class="col-md-6"style="padding:20px;">
       <h2>How the Script Works</h2>
       <p class="lead">The script starts with a synopsis of the conversation and introduces the characters. Then the conversation begins with the VuSitu app welcoming the user. The user states a goal right away, and that gets the interaction going.</p>

       <p class="lead">You can read through the exchange quickly. Notice how it highlights the things a user needs to "tell" the app.</p>

       <h2>How the Project Turned Out</h2>
       <p class="lead">Take a look at the finished screens at the bottom of this page to see the results. They don't include everything in the script. That's probably going to be true every time. The goal is to iterate on these.</p>

       <p class="lead">The UX designer said the script was a huge help in understanding the interaction before designing the wireframes. As the UX writer, the exercise of working through this conversation gave me early insight into what we were going to build. It helped me get into the user's head.</p>



       <p class="lead">There are already improvements in the works. In the near future, the process might involve the UX team sitting down and working on these together.</p>
